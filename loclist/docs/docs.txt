Checkin Algorithm
-----------------

1) Check in to a location (x,y)
2) Find location (X,Y) near (x,y)
3) If no location is found create new location (X,Y)=(x,y)


Data Model
----------
- Location: Geo location where a user checks in when using this application
- ItemList: List of ItemInstances - re-ordered for each location based on Ticks
- ItemInstance: Instance of an Item (includes quantity) assigned to an ItemList
- Item: Raw item (contains only text; optional: category)
- Category (optional): Used to group Items
- Tick: A checked Item at a certain Location (optional: with reference to ItemInstance)


Item Sort Algorithm
-------------------

1) Get location
2) Get ticks at location
3) Sort ticks by timestamp (but: also by checkin time or checkin count?)
