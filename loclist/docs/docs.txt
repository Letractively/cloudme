Checkin Algorithm
-----------------

1) Check in to a location (x,y)
2) Find location (X,Y) near (x,y)
3) If no location is found create new location (X,Y)=(x,y)


Item Sort Algorithm
-------------------

1) Get location
2) Get ticks at location
3) Sort ticks by timestamp (but: also by checkin time or checkin count?)
